The tasks we need to complete are:

- [ ] Classical simulation as a becnhmark, we should have two implementations one based on finite differences and the other one on PINNs
- [ ] Decide on the discretization scheme (HSN) or (QTN) we could also simulate using [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17206) or [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-021-03391-8)
- [ ] Decide on the SDK to use, maybe pennylane would be best
- [ ] Implementation of the chosen algorithm
- [ ] Validation and Benchmark functions for the quantum solution 
- [ ] Resources used by the quantum circuit and analysis
- [ ] Run algorithm on quantum Hardware
- [ ] Show scalability by augmenting the grid
- [ ] Conclusions and comparison
- [ ] Optional: Streamlit front end for resource characterization based on the grid size and simulation
